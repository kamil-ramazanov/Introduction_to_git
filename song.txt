[Verse 1]
Take, if you want a slice, if you want a piece
If it feels alright
Break, if you like the sound, if it gets you up
If it takes you down
Share, if it makes you sleep, if it sets you free
If it helps you breathe

Don't come over here and piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it off my wave

[Verse 2]
Cry, if you want to cry, if it helps you see
If it clears your eyes
Hate, if you want to hate, if it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave
Pray, if you want to pray, if you like to kneel
If you like to lay

Don't come over here and piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it off my wave
